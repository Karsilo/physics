## Definitions

**Escape Velocity**
- Velocity at which an objects kinetic energy is equal to its gravitational potential energy
- Same for all masses in the same gravitational field


## Derivations

The work done to escape the gravitational field is

$$
w = -Um = \dfrac{GMm}{r}
$$

so the kinetic energy we need is equal to $w$

$$
\dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 = \dfrac{GMm}{r}
$$

so our escape velocity comes out to

$$
v = \sqrt{\dfrac{2GM}{r}}
$$
