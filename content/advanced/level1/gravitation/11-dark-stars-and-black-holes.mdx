## Definitions

**Dark Star**

- A dark star is an object by which it's escape velocity exceeds that of the speed of light

**Schwarzschild Radius**

- Radius beyond which light cannot escape

**Event Horizon**

- The point at which nothing can escape

## Derivations

Taking our equation for escape velocity

$$
v = \sqrt{\dfrac{2GM}{R}}
$$

subbing in the speed of light $c$ for $v$

$$
R_s = \dfrac{2GM}{c^2}
$$

this is the **Schwarzschild Radius** for an object of mass $M$
